# Titanic-Survival-Prediction---Data-science-tools
This project uses the Titanic dataset to showcase the use of several data science tools. First, data engineering techniques to clean the dataset and generate new relevant variables are used. Then the effect of re-sampling techniques to balance the target classes are explored. Finally, several Machine Learning algorithms are evaluated and the best performing algorithm hyperparameters are tuned.

When comparing the best classification model performance before and after re-sampling is applied the gain in accuracy after balancing the target classes is of 10% approx.
